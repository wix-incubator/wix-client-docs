# Current Member Data

To return information about the current site visitor, use the [Get Current Member](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/members/members/get-current-member) method. The Current Member Data API is deprecated but you still can read the [article](https://dev.wix.com/docs/client/api-reference/deprecated/apis-deprecated/members/current-member-data) about it.
